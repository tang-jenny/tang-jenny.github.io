A best idea generate for the agency complay smart and elegant design When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me.\nI hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

Youtubers, Twitch streamers, and even my brother, a long-time critic of my video game tastes, loved this game. How did a seemingly random farming simulator manage to win over even the most obstinate casual game haters?\nAfter I spent 20 hours on the game, it was clear that these new farming sim converts never gave Harvest Moon a chance. From the music to the graphics to the villagers’ personalities, Stardew Valley IS a Harvest Moon game with all its staples including farming (obviously), house upgrades, friendship levels, festivals, and even mining combat (first introduced in Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon).\nThat is not to say Stardew Valley does not have its own merits; in fact, it is better than any Harvest Moon title to date. With its customization options, interesting characters, and hidden secrets, Stardew Valley has tweaked every aspect of the Harvest Moon formula to create a more mature and satisfying farming sim.\n STORY To escape the monotonous grind of the corporate machine, you quit and move to your grandfather’s old farm in Pelican Town.\nAfter a few days, the mayor expresses his desire to re-engage the community by restoring the community center. With an encroaching JojaMart right next door (and a smarmy manager to boot), you can either destroy the center and replace it with a Joja warehouse or complete item bundles to repair the building. The game makes it pretty clear which one is “morally right,” but the choice is yours.\nFrom there, you shape your own story: build your own winery; conquer the mines; date the local hot girl from high school; become the multi-millionaire you are destined to be.\n GAMEPLAY Restoring the community center provides a long-term goal for players who want more structure. The bundles consist of almost every item in the game from produce to fish to money. Your main source of income and gifts will come from your crops and livestock which can be purchased in town.\nAs you level up your skills, you will unlock item blueprints, and soon you will be turning your milk into cheese, eggs into mayonnaise, and grapes into wine. Unique to Stardew Valley, you can place your equipment wherever you want on your property. With an overwhelming amount of land to customize, you can spend hours designing and redesigning your farm.\nMining provides rare items and ores essential for blueprints and tool upgrades, but be extra careful of your health and stamina! If you pass out in the mines, not only will you lose hard-earned cash, but you will lose progress in your mining descent.\nFishing is a great way to find ingredients for recipes and gifts for villagers, and the mini-game is surprisingly difficult (a nice change of pace compared to classic j-RPGs and Animal Crossing).\nUnlike some past Harvest Moon games (\u0026hellip;Story of Seasons), I never find myself sleeping at 6pm due to lack of/gated content. Tickling by compulsive desire to optimize my gameplay, Stardew Valley has so much to do I plan days, weeks, in advance, constantly justifying my \u0026ldquo;Oh, but one more day!\u0026quot; cry at 3am.\nAdditionally Stardew Valley\u0026lsquo;s creator, Eric Barone, has proven himself to be an amazing game developer who frequently publishes free updates to the game including additional marriage candidates, events, and late game farming mechanics.\nFor more information, you can visit Barone’s developer blog.\n CHARACTERS Stardew Valley features an eclectic group of characters, some with pretty weird quirks (… Abigail), who experience real issues including alcoholism and depression.\nAs you talk to villagers, you will encounter special cutscenes that reveal more about a character’s personality. Regardless of your gender, there are 5 bachelor and 5 bachelorettes that you can marry. These characters have more frequent and fleshed out cutscenes and need a bouquet to pass 8 friendship hearts.\nAs a fan of game worlds that extend beyond the player (a la Legend of Heroes), I enjoy seeing the townspeople hangout with their friends without you (e.g. Friday night outings, weekly yoga sessions). My one wish is Stardew Valley included the marriage rivalry system of prior Harvest Moon games which paired up each bachelor/bachelorette, resulting in its own cutscene path. The changing relationships between townspeople gave the world an extra sense of progression that I am still missing.\n A TANGENT: CASUAL GAMES AND INDIE SUCCESS In general, \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo; games tend to be viewed negatively in the gaming community. I am so excited to see that an indie game can break the stigma of a casual genre game to become a worldwide sucess. I hope the success of Stardew Valley inspires other indie creators to create more chill simulation games focused on character. Selfishly, I am just looking for more games with cute graphics, interesting characters, and time management.\n ANOTHER TANGENT: HARVEST MOON VS STORY OF SEASONS In the West, the Harvest Moon series has been split into Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon. Due to legal drama, the Harvest Moon brand is owned by Natsume, the original US publishers of the series, and Harvest Moon\u0026lsquo;s new publisher, X-Seed, has to localize the new games under the title Story of Seasons. Natsume still makes Harvest Moon games, but they are\u0026hellip; not very good. The new Story of Seasons games are still experimenting with different mechanics, and if you really like Stardew Valley, I recommend supporting the brand \u0026ndash; I highly doubt that these games are making bank.\n TL;DR Believe the hype! Give it a chance. How in the world was this game developed by a single person? Just what? HOW?\n ","permalink":"https://tang-jenny.github.io/stardew-valley/","tags":["games"],"title":"Stardew Valley: A Nostalgic Treasure"},{"categories":["reviews"],"contents":"A little Pokemon, a little Digimon, a little Shin Megami Tensei; despite its shortcomings, Yo-Kai Watch‘s attention to detail will transport players to a magical town filled with child-like wonder.\n  As someone who has played almost every Level-5 game in the US, I want to start off by saying that I am biased.\nWith gorgeous cutscenes, dynamic worlds, fun personalities, and a catchy soundtracks, their games are analagous to an interactive anime.\nWith that said, if you are looking for any of the following in Yo-Kai Watch:\n a 100-hour main story an engaging battle system blood, gore, or psychological manipulation death, guns, and GTA Dark Souls pain  you will be severely disappointed.\nAnd if you want any of the following in your next game:\n weirdly entertaining humor daily pick-me-up activities a family-friendly experience a desire to catch ’em all  buy now or continue reading.\n STORY Yo-kai Watch has a fairly simple premise. The main character (anime: Nate) stumbles across a decrepit gachapon machine in the forest.\nNate inserts a coin, spins the lever, and out pops out a Yo-kai (Japanese for spirit, ghost, etc.) named Whisper who gives Nate a Yo-kai watch and introduces him to a mysterious and magical world.\nYo-kai are everywhere!\nWith the help of Whisper and the Yo-kai watch, Nate can now befriend Yo-kai around town, stop mischievous Yo-kai, and use Yo-kai to help others in need.\nIt is easy to see why children in Japan are obsessed with Yo-kai Watch. Its story captures a child’s naive and imaginative view of the world. From losing your mom’s wedding ring to being chewed out by your parents for not doing your homework, Yo-Kai Watch uses Yo-Kai to explain solutions to children’s everyday problems.\n MY FAVORITES Yo-kai Watch is packed with tons of content. You can catch critters, explore the town, traverse secret dungeons, complete side-quests, and catch over a hundred different Yo-Kai.\nIt takes advantage of the 3-DS camera and the game’s passionate online community. QR codes are offered when watching the Yo-Kai Watch anime on Disney X-D or when purchasing action figures and collectible coins. The internet has to work together to capture randomly generated criminals and piece together the weekly password.\nLevel-5 always delivers on graphics and presentation. The character movement is incredibly smooth. The color is vibrant and charming. The music is bouncy and fun. The attention to detail is out of this world: you can buy soda from the soda machines; jaywalking is frowned upon; even the loading screen is cute.\nAfter completing a sidequest, you get to watch a random little cutscene; the scene is always amusing (one involves all of the old Yo-Kai playing mini golf), and depending on the scene’s outcome, you might even receive a rare bonus item. Sometimes, you encounter random Yo-Kai on the streets which you have to chase down to get rare items. Early on in the plot, an old man asks you to fetch his underwear from the spa.\nYes. He has towel-clad old men as backup dancers. And yes, the game breaks the fourth wall and acknowledges it.\nLo-and-behold, you end up fighting a giant pig Yo-Kai who just happens to be wearing the exact underpants that the old man lost.\nTo top it off, it has one of the most nerve-racking mini-games I have ever encountered. Terror Time. Or the rampage of an angry red oni and his large mob of demon minions. Definitely not for the faint of heart. I almost passed out the first time.\n MY GRIPES Yo-Kai Watch’s main setback is its tedious gameplay. Catching rare critters is nearly impossible.\nIn order to even find a rare fish or bug, you have to inspect every single tree or river in the entire forest. Once you find one, before you can catch it, you have to play an random spinner mini-game which usually results in your loss.\nCatching Yo-Kai is even more infuriating. A Yo-Kai must approach you after a battle in order for you to recruit them to your team. To up those chances, you can feed a Yo-Kai its favorite food once during the battle. First, you must first figure out what its favorite food is, and if that is not difficult enough, it can take several battles before even the weakest Yo-Kai joins you.\nIt took me 10 battles before catch Slush, an E-rank Yo-kai. Just imagine how many times I would have to battle a Rank S Yo-Kai (and how many cheeseburgers or liver and chive plates I would have to feed it)!\nUnforunately with its battle system, the grind is just boring. The player takes the backseat as the Yo-Kai work.(The fast-forward button will be your best friend.)\nPlayers can rotate between six Yo-Kai and activate a Yo-Kai’s soultimate move by either tapping a few times, drawing a few circles, or tracing a few lines. It is too repetitive and simplistic to be fun.\n A LITTLE TANGENT: IMPOSSIBLE SUCCESS IN THE U.S.? Part of the game’s charm relies on the player’s inherent understanding and appreciation for Japanese culture. The little details that make the game so endearing, like the taking off shoes at the door or the charms at the Shinto shrine, are completely lost on a majority of Western audiences.\nWhile Japan has a variety of cute, monster-collecting games, in America there is only one, Pokemon. Despite Yo-Kai Watch’s good press and unique gameplay, due to its premise and target audience, it will always be seen as a Pokemon rip-off.\n TL;DR I really like this game. If you like cute games, get it. If you like Pokemon, try it. If you know a five-year-old kid who has a 3DS who wants a new video game, gift it. Else you might be better off saving your money for Fire Emblem.\n ","permalink":"https://tang-jenny.github.io/yokai-watch/","tags":["games"],"title":"Yo-Kai Watch: Charming AF"}]
