          <p><em>A beautiful homage to the <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> series, <strong>Stardew Valley</strong> is a modern farming simulator with a retro twist that reminds players of the charm of hard work, friendship, and lots and lots of parsnips.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/post/stardew/star-review.png" alt="star review"></p>
<hr>
<p>As someone who obsessed over <em>Harvest Moon</em> since I played <em>More Friends of Mineral Town</em> in middle school, I was surprised by the popularity of <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Youtubers, Twitch streamers, and even my brother, a long-time critic of my video game tastes, loved this game. How did a seemingly random farming simulator manage to win over even the most obstinate casual game haters?</p>
<p><img src="/images/post/stardew/abby-flute.gif#floatleft" alt="Abigail crushing at the flute"></p>
<p>After I spent 20 hours on the game, it was clear that these new farming sim converts never gave <em>Harvest Moon</em> a chance. From the music to the graphics to the villagers’ personalities, <em>Stardew Valley</em> <strong>IS</strong> a <em>Harvest Moon</em> game with all its staples including farming (obviously), house upgrades, friendship levels, festivals, and even mining combat (first introduced in <em>Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon</em>).</p>
<p>That is not to say <em>Stardew Valley</em> does not have its own merits; in fact, it is better than any <em>Harvest Moon</em> title to date. With its customization options, interesting characters, and hidden secrets, <em>Stardew Valley</em> has tweaked every aspect of the <em>Harvest Moon</em> formula to create a more mature and satisfying farming sim.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="story">STORY</h4>
<p><img src="/images/post/stardew/office.png#floatright" alt="Joja&rsquo;s offices">
To escape the monotonous grind of the corporate machine, you quit and move to your grandfather’s old farm in Pelican Town.</p>
<p>After a few days, the mayor expresses his desire to re-engage the community by restoring the community center. With an encroaching JojaMart right next door (and a smarmy manager to boot), you can either destroy the center and replace it with a Joja warehouse or complete item bundles to repair the building. The game makes it pretty clear which one is “morally right,” but the choice is yours.</p>
<p>From there, you shape your own story: build your own winery; conquer the mines; date the local hot girl from high school; become the multi-millionaire you are destined to be.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="gameplay">GAMEPLAY</h4>
<p>Restoring the community center provides a long-term goal for players who want more structure. The bundles consist of almost every item in the game from produce to fish to money. Your main source of income and gifts will come from your crops and livestock which can be purchased in town.</p>
<p>As you level up your skills, you will unlock item blueprints, and soon you will be turning your milk into cheese, eggs into mayonnaise, and grapes into wine. Unique to <em>Stardew Valley</em>, you can place your equipment wherever you want on your property. With an overwhelming amount of land to customize, you can spend hours designing and redesigning your farm.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post/stardew/mining.png#floatright" alt="Monsters at the mine"></p>
<p>Mining provides rare items and ores essential for blueprints and tool upgrades, but be extra careful of your health and stamina! If you pass out in the mines, not only will you lose hard-earned cash, but you will lose progress in your mining descent.</p>
<p>Fishing is a great way to find ingredients for recipes and gifts for villagers, and the mini-game is surprisingly difficult (a nice change of pace compared to classic j-RPGs and <em>Animal Crossing</em>).</p>
<p>Unlike some past <em>Harvest Moon</em> games (&hellip;<em>Story of Seasons</em>), I never find myself sleeping at 6pm due to lack of/gated content. Tickling by compulsive desire to optimize my gameplay, <em>Stardew Valley</em> has so much to do I plan days, weeks, in advance, constantly justifying my <em>&ldquo;Oh, but one more day!&quot;</em> cry at 3am.</p>
<p>Additionally <em>Stardew Valley</em>&lsquo;s creator, Eric Barone, has proven himself to be an amazing game developer who frequently publishes free updates to the game including additional marriage candidates, events, and late game farming mechanics.</p>
<p>For more information, you can visit <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/blog/">Barone’s developer blog</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="characters">CHARACTERS</h4>
<p><em>Stardew Valley</em> features an eclectic group of characters, some with pretty weird quirks (… Abigail), who experience real issues including alcoholism and depression.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post/stardew/dialogue.jpeg#floatright" alt=""></p>
<p>As you talk to villagers, you will encounter special cutscenes that reveal more about a character’s personality. Regardless of your gender, there are 5 bachelor and 5 bachelorettes that you can marry. These characters have more frequent and fleshed out cutscenes and need a bouquet to pass 8 friendship hearts.</p>
<p>As a fan of game worlds that extend beyond the player (a la <em>Legend of Heroes</em>), I enjoy seeing the townspeople hangout with their friends without you (e.g. Friday night outings, weekly yoga sessions). My one wish is <em>Stardew Valley</em> included the marriage rivalry system of prior <em>Harvest Moon</em> games which paired up each bachelor/bachelorette, resulting in its own cutscene path. The changing relationships between townspeople gave the world an extra sense of progression that I am still missing.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="a-tangent-casual-games-and-indie-success">A TANGENT: CASUAL GAMES AND INDIE SUCCESS</h4>
<p>In general, &ldquo;casual&rdquo; games tend to be viewed negatively in the gaming community. I am so excited to see that an indie game can break the stigma of a casual genre game to become a worldwide sucess. I hope the success of <em>Stardew Valley</em> inspires other indie creators to create more chill simulation games focused on character. Selfishly, I am just looking for more games with cute graphics, interesting characters, and time management.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="another-tangent-harvest-moon-vs-story-of-seasons">ANOTHER TANGENT: HARVEST MOON VS STORY OF SEASONS</h4>
<p>In the West, the <em>Harvest Moon</em> series has been split into <em>Story of Seasons</em> and <em>Harvest Moon</em>. Due to legal drama, the <em>Harvest Moon</em> brand is owned by Natsume, the original US publishers of the series, and <em>Harvest Moon</em>&lsquo;s new publisher, X-Seed, has to localize the new games under the title <em>Story of Seasons</em>. Natsume still makes <em>Harvest Moon</em> games, but they are&hellip; not very good. The new <em>Story of Seasons</em> games are still experimenting with different mechanics, and if you really like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, I recommend supporting the brand &ndash; I highly doubt that these games are making bank.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="tldr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Believe the hype! Give it a chance. How in the world was this game developed by a single person? Just what? HOW?</p>
